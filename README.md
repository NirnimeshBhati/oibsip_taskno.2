Unemployment Rate Analysis in India: This GitHub repository showcases my individual data science project focusing on analyzing the unemployment rates across different states in India. The project utilizes a dataset containing state names, dates, frequencies, estimated unemployment rates, estimated unemployed individuals, estimated labor participation rates, regions, longitudes, and latitudes.

The project begins with an exploration of the correlation matrix to uncover relationships between various factors and the unemployment rate. This analysis helps identify potential drivers and understand their impact on joblessness.

Moving on to data visualization, I employ advanced techniques to showcase the estimated unemployment rates across Indian states. Through interactive charts and graphs, I provide a visual representation of the variations and trends in unemployment rates across different regions.

To enhance the understanding of the data, I utilize the power of the sunburst chart, enabling the visualization of unemployment distribution across regions and demographic segments. This helps uncover patterns and disparities within the labor market.

Through statistical analysis and interactive visualizations, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the unemployment landscape in India. Researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders can benefit from this repository to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing unemployment and make data-driven decisions.
